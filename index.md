excerpt: "My Place on the Internet!"
---

I am a recent Master's graduate from the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, Canada. I was advised by Professor [Paul Lu](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~paullu/). I am interested in all things systems and networking.

During my Master's, I studied the evolution of the QUIC protocol. My thesis involved performance benchmarking and design study of the initial Google QUIC and the standardized IETF QUIC. This work has been [published](#publications) at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2024, Madrid, Spain.

Previously, I worked at Cisco as a Software Engineer where my job was to write software to automate the management of thousands of network devices in an enterprise network.

I am passionate about open source and have contributed to various projects. I recently went on a mission to turn my Mac into a private cloud using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app), which resulted in these projects:
* [Vagrant UTM](https://naveenrajm7.github.io/vagrant_utm/) - Automate your VM setup on Mac
* [Packer UTM plugin](https://github.com/naveenrajm7/packer-plugin-utm) - Automate building VMs on Mac
* [UTM Gallery](https://naveenrajm7.github.io/utm-gallery/) - Prebuilt VMs to use on your Mac
* [UTM Web] - Use your Mac as a home lab, spin up, manage, and connect to your VMs within your browser.
